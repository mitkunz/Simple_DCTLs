# Simple_DCTLs

DCTL (also known as Davinci Color Transform Language) is a programming language designed for creating custom effects and tools for Davinci Resolve.
Feel free to check out these DCTLs I made specifically for everyday color grading tasks.

## Technicolor Emulation

A little DCTL that simulates the Technicolor look. You can fine-tune the RGB Mix values and also enable a logarithmic rolloff function, to eliminate clipping.

Example             |  Settings Panel

## Film Saturation Emulation

This Saturation DCTL enables you to easily achieve rich levels of saturation without worrying about any color clipping in any channel. Also you get an overlay to see your changes based on a curve function.

Example             |  Settings Panel

## Adjustable Grey Card

Think of it as your trusty grey card, but with added perks. Not only does it allow you to fine-tune the black and white levels, but you also have the flexibility to adjust the displayed steps of dynamic range.

Example             |  Settings Panel

## Animatable Letterbox

This ist simply a Letterbox DCTL with presets of all the common formats (Scope, CinemaScope, Netflix, Flat, HDTV, iMax, Academy, Square, Instagram, Tim Tok), but this DCTL takes it a step further by being fully animatable. Now, you can dynamically adjust your aspect ratio using keyframes right on the color page.

Example             |  Settings Panel
